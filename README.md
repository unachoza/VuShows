## Overview

###### What is this project?

For the third project, you will work in small groups to accomplish various labs and exercises, but, this time, **we’re going to challenge you to work on a whole project with a small team.**

Not only will you be asked to **exercise additional creativity** in designing your project, but your instructors will also partner you with other classmates to architect, design, and collaboratively build an API of your design.

**This is meant to push you both technically and collaboratively.** Working in a team can be more challenging than working by yourself, but you're most likely going to find yourself working in a development team in your first job after WDI, and **it's important to learn how to work together.**

Make it work, and make it awesome.

---

## Technical Requirements

You must:

- **Use sequelize & Express** to build an API and a **React** front-end that consumes it
- **Create an Express API using, at minimum, two related models**
- Include **CRUD functionality** in a **RESTful API** for at least one of those models
- **Consume your own API** by making your front-end with React
- **Craft thoughtful user stories together**, as a team
- **Manage team contributions and collaboration** using a standard git workflow on GitHub
- **Designate one team member** to be in charge of managing team git workflow (the Git Dictator)
- Layout and style your front-end with **clean & well-formatted CSS**
- **Deploy your application online** so it's publicly accessible

### You must also include one of the following additional requirements

- **Auth**: A login/logout system
- **Third-Party API**: Use a third-party API, either from the frontend or the backend (if it has a key, it should be from the backend)
- **New NPM package**: Use an NPM package we haven't gone over in class

## Planning & Deliverables

###### What will we be turning in?

### Project Planning Deliverables

####Your team must review the following with your instructional team BEFORE you start to code.

* **Scope:** What are you planning to build? What do you reasonably think you can implement in the time period?
* **User Stories:** Who is your user? What features will your app have? Set up your project schedule in [GitHub Project](https://git.generalassemb.ly/wdi-nyc-arcadia/project-3/projects); write out your user stories in the README.
* **Wireframes:** Sketch out what your core pages will look like and how they will work. Consider making a *paper prototype* to demonstrate and/or test key user interactions.
* **Data Models:** Draw out the models and any associations for your project in an entity relationship diagram (ERDs).
* **Milestones:** Outline the milestones/sprints in GitHub Project.

### Completed Project Deliverables

- A **working API, built by the whole team**, hosted somewhere on the internet
- A handmade front-end **that consumes your own API**, hosted somewhere on the internet
- A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your Github repo
- A **team git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits from _every_ team member dating back to the _very beginning_ of the project
- **A ``README.md`` file** with:
    - Explanations of the **technologies** used
    - A couple of paragraphs about the **general approach you took**
    - **Installation instructions** for any dependencies
    - Link to your ERDs - Diagrams of your models and their relationships.
    - Link to your **user stories** – who are your users, what do they want, and why?
    - Link to your **wireframes** – sketches of  views and interfaces in your application
    - Descriptions of any **unsolved problems** or **hurdles** your team had to overcome

---

## Suggested Ways to Start

- **Don’t hesitate to write throwaway code** to solve short-term problems.
- **Read the docs for whatever technologies, frameworks, or API’s you use.**
- **Write your code DRY** and **build your APIs RESTful.**
- **Be consistent with your code style.** You're working in teams, but you're only making one app per team. Make sure it looks like a unified effort.
- **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
- **Keep user stories small and well-defined.** Remember – user stories focus on what a user needs, not what development tasks need accomplishing.
- **Write code another developer wouldn't have to ask you about.** Do your naming conventions make sense? Would another developer be able to look at your app and understand what everything is?
- **Make it all well-formatted.** Are you indenting, consistently? Can we find the start and end of every div, curly brace, etc.?
- **Comment your code.** Will someone understand what is going on in each block or function? Even if it's obvious, explaining the what & why means someone else can pick it up and get it.
- **Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the logic of something helps.

---

## Process

**Do not** immediately jump into coding.  For this sprint we want to carefully plan our approach. You **must** use the provided GitHub Project [template](https://git.generalassemb.ly/layne/project-2/projects).

- Database: Draw out the tables and columns you plan to use in your database (ERDs - Entity Relationship Diagram)
- Wireframes: Detail the flow of your app through simple wireframes
  * You can choose whether you want to whiteboard the wireframes, use some program or just sketch it out with pencil and paper.
  * Refer to the [todo app wireframe](./wireframes.md) for an example of what we expect!
- Routes: Design the HTTP route architecture of your application using  [RESTful conventions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer#Applied_to_Web_services)

- Set up a separate GitHub repository __(NOT this one)__ and **project board** (use the template provided) for your project
- Schema & Seeds: When you are confident with your ERD, define its tables in SQL and put into a schema file. For easier testing, write a seed file as well to insert sample data to your database.
- Models: Write a model with methods that use _async / await_ to perform CRUD on the database.

---

## Before you Start

- **Draw ERDs (diagrams of how your tables will look)**
- **Write user stories**
- **Build wireframes**
- **Write a list of 3rd party technologies** that you will be using and need to explore before you dive head first into your project
- **Write a project proposal** to present to your instructor
  - Your proposal should include: project summary / idea, wireframes, user stories, ERDs, additional requirement your group will tackle, and a project timeline. 

- **Define a styleguide** with your team. What fonts will you use, what color schemes? Be consistent with the styling.
- **Organize the project in terms of the directory structure etc.**

## Asking for Help
In a push for developer independence and self-reliance, we are going to adhere to [these rules](./asking-for-help.md) for receiving help during project week.

**You are going to encounter a ton of unexpected errors and problems.**

Expect to come up against a lot of what can **seem** like roadblocks. Push forward and through; these are amazing learning opportunities. A lot of students treat errors during projects as just getting in the way of "finishing". The point of this project is **not** to finish everything; the point is to integrate your knowledge and deepen your understanding of how to put apps together.

Errors provide the most valuable source of information about gaps in our understanding. Seeing an error as "it's not working" and randomly changing code until "it works" will make everything worse. Spending time thoughtfully debugging issues is a fantastic investment that will lead to greater mastery and understanding.

**Pro-Tip** - 'Failure is a temporary state.'

## About Plagiarism

General Assembly has a **zero tolerance policy** towards plagiarism and cheating. It is destructive to classroom culture, and exhibits a clear lack of respect for classmates, instructors, the company, and the greater community. Any work considered to have been plagiarised will not be accepted and will not count towards graduation requirements. If a project exhibits evidence of plagiarism or cheating, the student will not be able to display the project at a GA-sponsored class “science fair” or “meet & greet.” Any student found plagiarising or attempting to plagiarise will be disciplined accordingly (including but not limited to removal from class).

Open source code is inherently open and usually available for free use to modify and implement into any non-commercial project. However, please review their license and usage guidelines, give credit to the project and/or author, and do not try to hide or disguise the usage of such code.

You are encouraged to ask others, including students, instructors, and stackoverflow, for help. However, it is NOT ACCEPTABLE TO COPY another person's code and submit it as your own. More importantly, it is detrimental to your learning and growth.

All of the following are considered plagiarism or cheating:

- Turning in work that is not your own.
- Turning in someone else's work as your own.
- Hiring, or paying someone to do your work for you.
- Copying words or code without giving credit.
- Building or copying someone else’s idea without their knowledge or giving credit.
- Giving incorrect information about a source.
- Changing words, variable names, etc. but copying the code or files of a source without giving credit.
- Copying so many ideas or code blocks from a source that it makes up the majority of your work, whether you give credit or not.
- Failing to put a quotation in quotation marks.

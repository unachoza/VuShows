## Overview

You’ve already worked in small groups to accomplish various labs and exercises, but, this time, **we’re going to challenge you to work on a whole project with a small team.**

Not only will you be asked to **exercise additional creativity** in designing your project, but your instructors will also partner you with other classmates to architect, design, and collaboratively build an API of your design.

**This is meant to push you both technically and collaboratively.** Working in a team can be more challenging than working by yourself, but you're most likely going to find yourself working in a development team in your first job after WDI, and **it's important to learn how to work together.**

Make it work, and make it awesome.


## Technical Requirements

You must:

- **Use Postgres (pg-promise) & Express** to build an API and a **React** front-end that consumes it
- **Create an Express API using, at minimum, two related models**
- Include **CRUD functionality** in a **RESTful API** for at least one of those models
- **Consume your own API** by making your front-end with React
- **Craft thoughtful user stories together**, as a team
- **Create a project board** and use it to manage team workflow
- **Manage team contributions and collaboration** using a standard git workflow on GitHub
- **Designate one team member** to be in charge of managing team git workflow (the Git Dictator)
- Layout and style your front-end with **clean & well-formatted CSS**
- **Deploy your application online** so it's publicly accessible

### You must also include one of the following additional requirements

- **Auth**: A login/logout system
- **Third-Party API**: Use a third-party API, either from the frontend or the backend (if it has a key, it should be from the backend)
- **New NPM package**: Use an NPM package we haven't gone over in class

## Necessary Deliverables

- A **working API, built by the whole team**, hosted somewhere on the internet
- A handmade front-end **that consumes your own API**, hosted somewhere on the internet
- A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your Github repo
- A **team git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits from _every_ team member dating back to the _very beginning_ of the project
- **A ``readme.md`` file** with:
    - Explanations of the **technologies** used
    - A couple of paragraphs about the **general approach you took**
    - **Installation instructions** for any dependencies
    - Link to your ERDs - Diagrams of your models and their relationships
    - Link to your **user stories** – who are your users, what do they want, and why?
    - Link to your **wireframes** – sketches of  views and interfaces in your application
    - Descriptions of any **unsolved problems** or **hurdles** your team had to overcome


## Suggested Ways to Start

- **Don’t hesitate to write throwaway code** to solve short-term problems.
- **Read the docs for whatever technologies, frameworks, or API’s you use.**
- **Write your code DRY** and **build your APIs RESTful.**
- **Be consistent with your code style.** You're working in teams, but you're only making one app per team. Make sure it looks like a unified effort.
- **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
- **Keep user stories small and well-defined.** Remember – user stories focus on what a user needs, not what development tasks need accomplishing.
- **Write code another developer wouldn't have to ask you about.** Do your naming conventions make sense? Would another developer be able to look at your app and understand what everything is?
- **Make it all well-formatted.** Are you indenting, consistently? Can we find the start and end of every div, curly brace, etc.?
- **Comment your code.** Will someone understand what is going on in each block or function? Even if it's obvious, explaining the what & why means someone else can pick it up and get it.
- **Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the logic of something helps.


## Before you Start

- **Draw ERDs (diagrams of how your tables will look)**
- **Write user stories**
- **Build wireframes**
- **Write a list of 3rd party technologies** that you will be using and need to explore before you dive head first into your project
- **Write a project proposal** to present to your instructor
- **Create a project board** that outlines what steps you will need to take and the order you plan to take them in. [Here's an example!](https://github.com/jlr7245/healthify/projects/1)
- **Define a styleguide** with your team. What fonts will you use, what color schemes? Be consistent with the styling.
- **Organize the project in terms of the directory structure etc.**


## Project Timeline

| Date            | Action                                                                                                          |
|:-----------------:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **2/14**    | Start thinking of ideas with your group               |
| **2/16**   | **PROJECT PROPOSALS!** Please have wireframes, user stories, and a project board completed for us to review.           |
| **2/19**   | **President's Day!** But you should still be working...                                                         |
| **2/20-2/22**     | Work on projects!                                                                                               |
| **2/23**            | **PROJECT PRESENTATIONS!**                 |

## Project Feedback + Evaluation

- __Project Workflow__: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes as specified above? Did you use source control (Git) as expected for the phase of the program you’re in (detailed above)?

- __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

- __Creativity__: Did you added a personal spin or creative element into your project submission?

- __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

- __Deployment__: Did you deploy your application to a public url using Heroku?

- __Presentation__: Did you present your code, and your project-making experience clearly and effectively to the class?

- __Teamwork__: Did you work effectively in a group?

- __Total__: Your instructors will give you a score for each section between:

| Score          | Expectations   |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| **0**          | _Incomplete._  |
| **1**          | _Does not meet expectations._ |
| **2**          | _Meets expectations, good job!_ |
| **3**          | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_ |

This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!

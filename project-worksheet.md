- API call
- React front end with 6+ components, including Header and search bar
- User created favorites
- CRUD functionality
- Algorithmnic sorting & concatenation
- Using Trello to manage tasks and collaboration

- Deployment

#### PostMVP 

- Incorporate specifically tailored D3 visualizations
- Animation/ gif
- Quote Generator
- Series progress tracker

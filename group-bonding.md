## Team Bonding/Project Prep

It's important to take time to fuse as a team. To get you started, please tackle the following, by **End of Day Thursday**.

**PLEASE NOTE:** All of the steps below are **MANDATORY**

### Why are you here?

Take time for each person to talk about their background, what drew them to code, and why they are here.

### How will you work together?

Watch the [Does a developer need to be nice?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9OpTNk0hYc) video together as a group and talk about how you can create an environment where everyone's contributions are valued.

### Review Project Two

Have each person go to their Project Two Github Repo and walk the other team members through their code. Make sure to touch on the following:

- Your biggest win and the journey to get there.
- Your greatest struggle and what you learned.
- Your overall strengths and weaknesses as a developer.

*Remember* - Being able to explain your code is as important as being able to code. This is great practice, so take it seriously!

### Project Three Brainstorm

- Pick a group name! Be ready to explain why you chose that name.
- Brainstorm some project ideas. Remember, there's no bad ideas in brainstorming, so be open to possibilities.

You will present your project proposals on Friday 2/16!
